### 👋 Hi there

My name is Akinyele Cafe-Febrissy. I'm a Software Developer <b>[on the web](https://www.akinyele.ca)</b>.

Most of my time is spent making my life and others' easier. I build for the long term and thrive on collaboration and trust.

### 💻 My professional interests
- Developer experience: I build tools for developers and prefer automation over manual work.
- Backend development: I design backend systems from requirements to finished product and care for post-deployment maintenance.
- Frontend developement: I ensure that APIs and frontend components have the right level of concern and that logic is where it belongs.

### 🔭 On my free time...

I like to work on:
- 🎵 A bot that analyzes basic music trend to complement Spotify's insights.
- 📱 A near-feature complete manga reading app based on [Mangadex](https://mangadex.org) compatible with Android and iOS.
- 💎 A [Mangadex](https://mangadex.org) gem that interacts with their latest API. [Check it out](https://github.com/thedrummeraki/mangadex)!

Some of my recent hobbies include:
